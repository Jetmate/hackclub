# Pico-8 Action Game

## Why Pico-8?
I consider Pico-8 to be *the best* way to introduce newcomers to coding because of just how fun it is to code in it. Unlike traditional game engines, Pico-8 manages to preserve a traditional coding feel while also streamlining the whole game development process: you still write legitimate Lua code and implement all game systems (like animation, physics, and scenes) yourself. This is good in the long run because that means that beginners get to actually code their games from scratch, rather than gluing together a bunch of pre-made elements. At the same time, however, Pico-8 makes implement graphics, tilemaps, and even music a breeze by including all of those tools into the same package. This means that there's no more need in teaching beginners multiple pieces of software and how to make them work together, as everything is already there: for example, displaying a sprite from a spritesheet is as simple as `spr(0)`!

There's quite a bit to Pico, so this has been split into a few workshops--see the next section for the order.
